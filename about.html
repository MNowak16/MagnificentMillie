            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Millie!  I am approximately 2 years old and was formerly a feisty street cat. I was
                taken in to <a href="https://lakelandanimalshelter.org/" target="_blank">Lakeland Animal Shelter</a>
                with two baby kittens. My little babies found their forever homes, and I was quickly adopted soon after.
                Now I am happy being a snuggly house kitty. I love playing with my toys, napping, and checking out
                birds outside. My favorite is when my mom works from home because then I'm able to attach the little
                bug on her screen that keeps moving around. She gets mad, but I'm just trying to help!</p>
            <p>Having been an outside cat almost my whole life, I LOVE the outdoors. One of my favorite past times is
                watching the birds from my window and reflecting fondly on my former hunting days. There is a huge
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhill_crane" target="_blank">sandhill crane</a> that comes
                into my yard that I enjoy hunting from my window. One of these days, I'm going to push out the screen
                and meet him.</p>
            <p>While I like hunting and playing, I don't much care for cheese and catnip like many other cats. I hear
                it's good stuff. It's just not for me. I prefer my food fresh and warm.</p>
            <p>I'm so smart that I even learned how to do tricks like a dog. Check them out!</p>
